### Introduction
Vehicle Insurance Fraud is a major area of losses to the auto insurance companies. Study conducted by
Verisk, indicated that insurance companies had to bear losses to the tune of $29 billion a year [1](https://www.iii.org/article/background-on-insurance-fraud).
According to Progressive, auto insurance fraud is committed when someone falsely claims about an event
and get monetarily compensated[2](https://www.progressive.com/answers/car-insurance-fraud). In this project an attempt has been made to explore major
contributing factors which have led to fraud along with developing models which can distinguish
fraudulent transactions. For this model data is obtained from [Vehicle Insurance Claim Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/vehicle-claim-fraud-detection)

### Problem statement
How can Data Science be leveraged to detect Vehicle Insurance Fraudulent claims to reduce losses on 
account of exaggerated and false claims about accidents, property damage and physical injury by 
developing machine learning models which can improve the accuracy as measured by F1 SCORE to 
above 0.8 in 6 months
